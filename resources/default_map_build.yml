# MimeMap
#
# This file provides the default script to build the MIME-type to file extension
# map. It is used as input to the 'fileeye-mimemap' utility.
#
# The script fetches a mapping source available from the Apache's documentation
# website, merges it with another mapping source from the freedesktop.org
# project, integrates the result with any overrides specified by
# 'applyOverrides', and finally updates the PHP file where the
# '\FileEye\MimeMap\Map\DefaultMap' class is stored.
#
# The entries are executed sequentially; each entry indicates a MapUpdater
# method to be invoked and the arguments to be passed in.


# The Apache httpd project contains the most complete list of file extension to
# mime type mapping on the planet. We use it to update our own list.
